### Welcome



I am a software engineer and recent graduate from lambda school's full stack web dev program. 

All of my (excellently coded) projects and class work from Lambda can be found through my github.

I am currently diving into JS/Node.

I can be reached at christian.martin.auld@gmail.com

Thanks for looking !
